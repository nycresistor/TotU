Good News!  Burning Man Arts has accepted our Letter of Intent and invited us to submit a full proposal.  We're feverishly working on it now to get everything in by the Jan 30th deadline.  We've committed the [letter we submitted](https://github.com/nycresistor/TotU/raw/master/Logistics/Burning%20Man%20Arts%20-%20SlideRoom.pdf) to the [GitHub](https://github.com/nycresistor/TotU).

The full proposal expands on the LOI looking for more detail in the description, logistics, budget and project plan.  You can find the list of questions in the proposal in the [Burning Man Arts SlideRoom](https://burningmanarts.slideroom.com/#/login/program/24375/202Q0wbI88).
