Making some good progress on the electronic side. We have one prototype board with 32 output channels, full 10 FPS video and 8 bit backlight PWM. Our software is able to accept 32 images in any format, convert them for playback, load them in, and spit them out to 32 screens in a matter of seconds on a Beaglebone Black. 

We've ordered all the necessary parts to build a full 64-screen working prototype (1/8th of our planned project). While we wait for parts to arrive, Justin is working on implementing a network API for our display software, and I'm working on additional software to orchestrate image display and backlight control automatically. We're also making another Lowes run tomorrow to continue protoyping our physical structures. We expect to have a full unit prototype within the next two weeks and a full working physical unit by the end of March, putting us well on track to scale up before Burning Man.
