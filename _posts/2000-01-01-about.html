Guiding Philosophy

<p class="section-text">For every participant who makes it out to Black Rock City there are many who do not.  Participants who don’t make it Home can listen to BMIR, watch Ustream, and send postcards to their friends, but don’t have any way to express themselves with any sort of immediacy.  The goal of the Temple of the Unticketed is to connect participants on and off playa in a way that is immediate, playful, and respectful of the Ten Principles.</p>

<p class="section-text">The Temple of the Unticketed encourages participants to record four frame vignettes through a virtual photo booth app.  The app can be accessed off playa via the web, and on playa via a kiosk or a WLAN network near the piece.  Playful filters and theme suggestions are included to encourage participant creativity.</p>

<p class="section-text">Vignettes will be displayed on the physical piece as well as a virtual one.  The two pieces will stay in sync so participants feel a connection to each other.  The physical piece will have several modes of low bandwidth access to download submitted vignettes.</p>   

<p class="section-text">The Temple of the Unticketed features a couple of other subtle aspects.  As new submissions are added, old ones are deleted permanently, a digital equivalent of leave no trace and a reminder of the importance of immediacy.  Vignette images are tinted and started in patterns such that from a distance the temple displays themes of time, space and connectivity.</p>

<p class="section-text">Interacting with the Temple of the Unticketed should leave participants feeling connected to a larger community and a sense that the Ten Principles can extend beyond the borders of Black Rock City.</p>
